What's fullstack dev? -> when you write bugs that run on the server and the client
How did fullstack look 10 years ago => show PHP example + explain -> 30s

Problems -> client side is hard to do
Bad editor tooling
"Not cool anymore"

Is anyone doing this?
Ok besides this guy

So what did we invent to fix this?

-> graphql example

-> show how to do the backend example
-> show typegen
-> show client side code

Ok so this is wayyyy more code, but what did we get?
nice tooling + really nice client side + great for multiclient architectures

Cool... but it's literarly 7x the code size

Can we do it simpler?

Introducing appDir (and also astro, but I'm gonna focus on next appDir)

So we had this notion of metaframeworks (add metaframework joke)

Show simple query example

Show client side code

How did the actions work in PHP?
Show actions in Next

So the most important part of all of this is that for me
- First time it's been simple to write stuff like this in years
- It's fun again since I'm not writing so much boilerplate

BUT
- Your mileage may vary
1. are you a big team? -> you're can mix these patterns
2. already have GQL? -> why not fetch part and stream with appDir?
3. hate next? -> astro and remix are amazing

But most importantly, do you have an app that works and that you're happy with?
DON'T GO AND CHANGE IT JUST BECAUSE I SAID SO

Cause In the end, it doesn't even matter
What matters is that you're happy and shipping features
